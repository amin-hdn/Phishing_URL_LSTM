In this repo you will find a classification model based on LSTM units. This model is for phishing URL detection

how can u deal will this repo:
## Preprossesing :
Preprosseing.ipynb  file : contain all the feature and all the steps that we apply on the data to acheive the Preprossessing.
## LSTM_model : 
LSTM_stand_Sal.ipynb file : contain the contruction of the LSTM_model.
## test our model :
One_URL_preprossessing.ipynb is to test our model.
