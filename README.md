# Project desription
In this repo you will find a classification model based on LSTM units. This model is for phishing URL detection that resulted in an  accuracy of 87%.


here's a brief description of the contents of this repo:
## Preprossesing :
Preprosseing.ipynb  file : contains the Preprossessing steps we applied on the initial dataset to get the appropriate features (34).
## LSTM_model : 
LSTM_stand_Sal.ipynb file : contain the contruction of the LSTM_model.
## test our model :
One_URL_preprossessing.ipynb is to use the model test URLs.
