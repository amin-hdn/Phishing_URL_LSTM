# Phishing_URL_LSTM
Detect phishing URL using Deep Learning, (LSTM network).

"This paper focuses on using DL algorithms for detecting
phishing URLs. Particularly, a novel hybrid deep learning
model, which combines the power of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model
using **the lexical and statistical analysis**
of URLs and a long short-term memory network (LSTM)-
based model using character embedding-based features,
was proposed and validated using phishing detection
datasets." from an article ??

## Fisrt we should tranform URL to a DATA informations :
  HOW ?  **the lexical and statistical analysis** using DNN
  
## Second we should create a LSTM Model Network Model :
  HOW ?  character embedding-based features using (LSTM) 
## Third we should verify :
